      <description>In the spirit of birding, I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with a game that celebrates the incredible biodiversity around us. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple: tally up all the types of life you&amp;rsquo;ve seen. You get one point for each unique species, two points for each genus, 3 points for a family, 4 points for an order, 5 points for a class, and 10 points for a phylum. Add them all up (made easier through iNaturalist, Bugguide, and eBird) and see what you get!</description>

      <description>How mistletoe got associated with Christmas is a bit of a mystery, but it’s probably because mistletoe is one of the few plant species that is green even in the winter. Imagine planning a winter celebration around 900 AD in northern Europe (just ignore the serfdom and disease for a moment): one of the few plants you could use for decoration would be mistletoe, since most other plants have either lost their leaves or died back in the middle of winter.</description>

      <description>PhD research My PhD research is focused on understanding:
 The extent to which the northeastern US is experiencing widespread population-level insect declines (ie. the windshield phenomenon) What factors are driving these potential declines &amp;amp; How insectivorous birds are responding.  ​These are big questions &amp;ndash; I use a variety of approaches to chip away at them, from resurveys of historical data, to evidence synthesis (like entoGEM), to community science.</description>

      <title>How to paddle the Mississippi River</title>
      <link>https://grahammontgomery.eco/writing/mississippi/</link>

      <description>Interested in paddling America’s great river from source to sea, or maybe a section of it? There are some really nice resources out there already (see below), but I will try to supplement them here. I kayaked the Mississippi solo in the fall of 2016, and it was the trip of a lifetime. It took me 62 days and over one million paddles to travel the 2100 miles of river on my route (~3500 km)!</description>
